## Objective-C Prework 

Before you begin the pre-work in this section, please make sure you've done all the pre-work in Swift first. While we'll cover Objective-C in the iOS immersive course, having a strong grasp of Swift should be your first priority. 

In the Objective-C lessons, you'll notice that many of the same concepts are covered but within the syntax and conventions of a new language. This will help reinforce the programming fundamentals that you've learned already. 

Happy learning!
